While we were working on wordladder.cpp, we found an error when we were taking in inputs for the beggining and end of Word Ladder
and storing them into the variables startWord and endWord. Though the program worked when we entered the words for the first ladder,
when we tried to enter in a second pair of words, startWord would change, but endWord wouldn't change, leading to the strange scenario
where it would make a ladder between incorrect words.This error occurred as a result of earlier code using a break statement to exit
a while loop and create the word ladder, which would lead to one word being assigned but the other being bypassed.To fix this code,
as well as clean it up a bit, we rewrote the input into a function that returns a boolean instead of relying on a break statement, 
and it is much cleaner and more concise. This function is a much better system as instead of determining if there was an error
after the words were inputted by calling a seperate function while in the while loop, we combined it into one function so we removed
the necessity for the while loop and break statements that caused the error earlier, thus resolving the logic error.
